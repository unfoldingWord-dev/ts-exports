<p>
A sacrifice is an offering to God of something valuable as a form of worship.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The Israelites made several different kinds of sacrifices. These included sacrifices to ask God to forgive sin and sacrifices to thank him for blessings.</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Most sacrifices involved killing an animal and offering it to God as a gift.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Animal sacrifices could never truly make a person clean from his sin. Only the sacrifice of Jesus, God&#039;s perfect, sinless Son, can cleanse people from sin.
